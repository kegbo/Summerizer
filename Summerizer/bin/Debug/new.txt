Artificial intelligence is intelligence exhibited by machines
 Colloquially, the term artificial intelligence is applied when a machine mimics cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as learning and problem solving As machines become increasingly capable, facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition
 General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals


The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it
